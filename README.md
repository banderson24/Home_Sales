# Home_Sales
##  Challenge Overview
The challenge here was to use SparkSQL to answer the provided questions about home sales data. We had to read in our data, use Spark to create temporary views, query the views, partition the data, cache and uncache a temporary table, and then verify that the table has been uncached. The Home_Sales.ipynb includes the code for the assignment. Code was sourced from activities performed in class. Used SQL knowledge to answer the related questions.
